OVERVIEW:
  This project, Budgy(working name - budget buddy) aims to be a budget/finance tracker app. At its most basic form, users will be able to manually input their account amount and set goals that they wish to reach.

FEATURES(keep in mind, everuthing needs to be manually entered until we can integrate with a mock back account database):
  
    Add goal: set financial amount to be saved towards
  
    Add/Edit goal partition: Change the amount being set as the goal
  
    Delete Goal: Self-Explanatory
  
    Budget Check: Checking if you are within budget based on spending amount entered
  
    Account Amount Update: Update the total amount on the account
  
    View Account: Display the account with the total amount and goals/budgets(potentially both as dollar amounts and as percentages of the total)

POTENTIAL FUTURE FEATURES:
  
    Automatic budgeting: Basic income split based on user specifications(Think savings, needs/bills, wants)
    
    Spending Categories: Separate spending into classes based on category(Subscription, food, transport etc.)
    
    Time Goal: Set goals to be completed my a certain day. Suggestions for how much to put towards that goal per pay period
